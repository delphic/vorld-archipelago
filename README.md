# Vorld Archipelago

Vorld is short for Voxel World. Archipelago is an island chain.

Vorld Archipelago is an attempt to bring together previous vorld experiments into one code base and expanded it to generate an interesting voxel archipelago to explore.

However it does not contain the multiplayer functionality of [vorld-decay](https://github.com/delphic/vorld-decay).
